#+TITLE: nix configuration 🐹

I am using [[https://nixos.org][nixos]] on my computers (mainly laptops and desktops).

I want to be able to configure syntax highlighting and also some magic tricks
with it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package nix-mode
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

[[https://github.com/direnv/direnv/][direnv]] is awesome and I'm relying on it quite a lot — mainly because it has this
magic =use_nix= support that will rely on the =default.nix= file in the folder
(or parents) you are in.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package direnv
    :ensure t
    :init
    (setq direnv-always-show-summary t)
    (direnv-mode t))
#+END_SRC

* Provide configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (provide 'nix-config)
#+END_SRC
